  CSS introduction

  Css is the language we use to style a web page.
  what is CSS?

  - Css describes how html elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
  - Css saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
  - External stylesheets are stored in css files.

  Css is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Nisi quas a vitae perferendis excepturi, maiores culpa, nulla animi beatae soluta error voluptate facere tenetur magnam incidunt magni at dolorem voluptatibus.</p>
  </body>
</html>

  Css solved a big problem
  html was never intended to contain tags for formatting a web page
  html was created to describe the content of a web page, like h1 and p

  When tags like font and color attributes were added to the html 3.2 specification, it started a nigthmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page became a long and expensive process.

  to solve this problem the world wide web consortium W3C created css
  css removed the style formatting from the html page


  css saves a lot of work
  
  the style definitions are normally saved in external .css file
  with an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file.
