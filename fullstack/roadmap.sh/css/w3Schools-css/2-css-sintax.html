    css syntax

    A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block

    css syntax:

    SELECTOR   DECLARATION      DECLARATION
       h1      {color:blue;     font-size:10px;}
              property:value      property:value
    
    The selector points to the html element you want to style
    The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons
    Each declaration includes a css property name and a value, separated by a colon
    Multiple css declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
    Example:
 -->
<html>

<head>
    <style>
        p /* selector*/
        /* declaration block */
        {
            /*declaration - property:value*/
            color: red;
            /*declaration - property:value*/
            text-align: center;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Nobis necessitatibus corrupti dolor quibusdam, velit
        odio iure vitae excepturi molestiae porro quasi expedita doloribus cum natus eveniet, quam sunt ad accusamus.
    </p>
</body>

</html>

    Example explained

    p is a selector in css (it points to the html element you want to style: <p>)
    
    color is a property and red is the property value

    text-align is also a property and center is also a property value
