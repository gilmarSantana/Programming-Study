    <h1>JavaScript Statements</h1>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <pre>
        <code>
            let x, y, z; // statement 1
            x = 5; // statement 2
            y = 6;  // statement 3
            z = x + z;  // statement 4
        </code>
    </pre>

    <h1>JavaScript Programs</h1>
    <p>
        A computer program is a list of instructions to be executed by a computer. <br>
        In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements. <br>
        A js program is a list of programming statements. <br>
        JavaScript statements are composed of:
    <ul>
        <li>Values</li>
        <li>Operators</li>
        <li>Expressions</li>
        <li>Keywords</li>
        <li>Comments</li>
    </ul>

    The statement below tells the browser to write Hello Dolly. Inside an html element with id="demo"

    <pre>
            <code>
                document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = "Hello Dolly"
            </code>
        </pre>

    Most js programs contain many js statements <br>
    The statements are executed one by one in the same order as they are written.
    </p>

    <h1>Semicolons (;)</h1>
    <p>
        Semicolons separate js statements. <br>
        Add a demicolon at the end of each executable statement.
    <pre>
            <code>
                let a, b, c;  // Declare 3 variables
                a = 5;        // Assign the value 5 to a
                b = 6;        // Assign the value 6 to b
                c = a + b;    // Assign the sum of a and b to c
            </code>
        </pre>
    When separeted by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:
    <pre>
        <code>
            a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;
        </code>
    </pre>
    </p>

    <h2>On the web, you might see examples without semicolons. Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but
        highly recommended.</h2>

    <h1>JavaScript White Space</h1>
    <p>
        JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable. <br>

        The following lines are equivalent:
    <pre>
            <code>
                let person = "Hege";
                let person="Hege";

                A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):

                let x = y + z;
                Instead of:
                let x=y+z;
            </code>
        </pre>
    </p>
    <hr>
    
</body>
