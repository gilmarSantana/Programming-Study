  Headngs are important

  Search engines use the headngs to index the structure and content of your web pages.
   Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headngs to show the document structure.
   h1 headngs shoud be used for main headngs, followed by h2 headings, then the less important h3, and so on.

   Note: Use html headngs for headngs only. Don't use headngs to make a big or bold text.
